# Random-password-generator
Security on the Internet is critical. One of the things that you as an Internet user can do is use strong passwords. Strong passwords are typically long sequences of random characters, and you should have a different password for each account on the Web. 
Create a console Python program to help generate random passwords based on simple settings. 

1. Main menu
The main menu should show the name of the program and the options. It should then accept input from the user.
2. Password generation
Three groups of characters can be used in the passwords: 

   letters: a-z 

   digits: 0-9 

   special characters: !@#$%&*A I()_+
